# Ukulele-tuner
A real time ukulele tuner that implements the concepts of digital signal processing to assist the user in tuning their instruments. This is done by frequency analysis techniques and by producing spectrograms. 

This specific ukulele tuner code captures audio input, processes it to identify the dominant pitch, compares it to target frequencies for standard ukulele tuning, and provides feedback to the player for tuning adjustments. It repeats this process until the user decides to exit. The spectrogram visualization helps the player understand the frequency content of the audio and the presence of peaks corresponding to the ukulele strings.
